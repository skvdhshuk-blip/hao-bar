# Changelog

All notable changes to SaneBar are documented here.

---

## Unreleased

---

## [2.1.90] - 2026-08-22

Settings uses the shared SaneUI page on every tab: one gutter, a 720-wide window that can resize without stretching off-screen, and the same label-left / control-right rows. About has More Apps (saneapps.com) and a working Donate button. Shortcuts no longer shifts the left margin. First-run Health no longer crams four buttons off the window, and the check does not auto-open when Accessibility is already granted. Free builds skip the login-keychain prompt at launch.

---

## [2.1.89] - 2026-07-04

Donation prompt and onboarding polish for the open-source SaneBar build.

---

## [2.1.88] - 2026-06-30

SaneBar is now free and fully open source under the MIT License. Every Pro feature is unlocked for everyone — no license key, no trial.

SaneBar is being sunset: macOS 27 "Golden Gate" rebuilds the menu bar and breaks menu bar managers. Thank you for everything. Source and contributions: https://github.com/sane-apps/SaneBar

---

## [2.1.87] - 2026-06-30

More reliable icon-moving during display changes, Space switches, and wake. Some notched and multi-display setups still hit macOS limits this cannot fully fix. I will email all paid users soon about macOS 27 and what it means for SaneBar.

---

## [2.1.86] - 2026-06-30

Improves moving menu-bar icons between Visible, Hidden, and Always Hidden, especially on notched MacBooks. Moving an icon to the visible area now aims for a safe drag point near the notch instead of giving up. Pinning one app no longer pulls its same-named companions into Always Hidden, and move verification double-checks against the live menu bar. Verified with real moves on a notched display.

---

## [2.1.85] - 2026-06-29

Quiets a menu-bar flicker some people see every few minutes. When the hidden-icons separator sits parked off-screen — its normal position while icons are hidden — macOS can momentarily report it as missing, and SaneBar would rebuild its menu-bar items on every Space switch or app change, which shows up as a brief flash. SaneBar now recognizes when its main icon is present and stable and stops rebuilding in that case, so the flicker should settle down. This was confirmed on a real affected machine, where the rebuild churn dropped to zero. If you saw this flicker on a multi-monitor setup, this update is aimed at it. Genuinely missing icons still recover as before.

---

## [2.1.84] - 2026-06-28

Further improves menu-bar divider stability around sleep and wake: closes more of the cases where the divider could drift toward Control Center after waking even when your displays had not changed. Hover reveal is more deliberate too: moving your cursor over SaneBar's own icon no longer reveals hidden icons instantly, it now waits for your Reveal delay like the rest of the menu bar. Also adds a way back in when macOS does not place SaneBar's menu-bar icon at launch: relaunching SaneBar now reliably opens a window so you can reach Settings and the Health screen instead of the app being unreachable.

---

## [2.1.83] - 2026-06-26

Fixes icon moves that still failed after recent updates: moving icons between Hidden/Visible/Always Hidden now works (verified on notched built-in displays), and the right-click move menu now shows the correct options for an icon's actual zone. Adds recovery for the menu-bar separator when macOS parks it off-screen so moves stop silently doing nothing.

---

## [2.1.82] - 2026-06-25

Stops the menu bar revealing on its own: hover and scroll reveal now wait for a deliberate 2-second Reveal delay (adjustable in Settings) instead of popping open the moment your cursor passes by. Also fixes updates not applying cleanly when you are several versions behind: the newest version now always takes over, so you no longer get stuck on an older build.

---

## [2.1.81] - 2026-06-25

Your menu bar divider and icon order now stay put through sleep/wake, Space switches, and display changes — no more snapping back toward Control Center. Also fixes moving icons out of Always Hidden, license-key recognition, and unresponsive icon dragging.

---

## [2.1.80] - 2026-06-23

Improves SaneBar divider/layout stability after app activation, Space changes, wake, and display transitions.

---

## [2.1.79] - 2026-06-23

Pro is now free to try for 14 days. Updated default settings based on customer feedback: hover and scroll reveal are off by default, drag reveal stays on, and auto-hide uses a calmer 5-second delay. Improved license-key paste handling and companion app recommendations.

---

## [2.1.78] - 2026-06-22

Pro is now free to try for 14 days. Basic remains included after the trial.

---

## [2.1.77] - 2026-06-22

Pro is now free to try for 14 days. Basic remains included after the trial.

---

## [2.1.76] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- Keeps Custom Appearance out of Mission Control and Spaces control surfaces when macOS leaves another app frontmost.
- Removes unused settings and status-item forwarding code while preserving existing menu bar recovery behavior.

---

## [2.1.75] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- Avoids notch-unsafe menu bar drag origins on MacBook displays while preserving normal moves on external displays.
- Improves release smoke testing so notched laptop runs use live geometry from the app before moving menu bar icons.

---

## [2.1.74] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- Stops a recovery loop that could make Settings reopen unexpectedly or disturb saved layouts when the menu bar was already hidden correctly; postponed wake repairs now appear in Settings > Health for manual repair.
- Improves moving icons out of Always Hidden after restart, wake, or display changes, including wide menu bars.
- Reduces repeated background retries after Always Hidden moves, lowering CPU/memory churn and avoiding extra layout disturbance.
- Gives AppleScript users clearer next steps when an icon cannot be found or moved.

### Changed

- Icon-moving AppleScript automation now requires Pro consistently. Basic still supports browse, click, and list commands.

---

## [2.1.73] - 2026-06-19

Improves Always Hidden icon moves after wake/display changes.
Restores hidden menu bar layouts more reliably after display sleep, Spaces, and off-screen window recovery.
Keeps Health repair consistent with Touch ID protection for hidden icons.

---

## [2.1.72] - 2026-06-17

Improves Browse Icons reliability when moving items between Visible, Hidden, and Always Hidden. Reduces background menu-bar scanning work and strengthens resource checks so idle memory growth is caught before release.

---

## [2.1.71] - 2026-06-17

Fixed Always Hidden icon move reliability after restart, display wake, and recovery. Improved menu bar geometry handling for multi-display setups. Added clearer Health guidance when macOS hides SaneBar from the menu bar.

---

## [2.1.70] - 2026-06-16

Improves macOS 27 Spaces and Mission Control handling for Custom Appearance, including active-Space refresh and hidden-state recovery after Space changes.

---

## [2.1.69] - 2026-06-15

Improves restart and recovery when macOS attaches SaneBar's menu bar items off-screen after reboot. SaneBar now waits for live status-item anchors before replaying hidden-state layout, clears poisoned status-item autosave state more reliably, and keeps recovery passive while the menu bar rebuilds.

---

## [2.1.68] - 2026-06-12

Adds AppleScript target-relative menu bar icon reordering within the same section: `move icon before` and `move icon after`.

---

## [2.1.67] - 2026-06-11

Major reliability release for menu bar layout and recovery. Fixes the missing-icon recovery dead end (Repair always acts and points to System Settings when macOS hides SaneBar's icons). Cached geometry is bound to the display arrangement it was observed under, so recovery can no longer replay coordinates from a different monitor setup. Displays arranged left of the primary work correctly. Moving icons to visible is far more reliable (drags target the middle of the visible lane). Automatic layout restores only run with verified geometry and never move the cursor during wake; postponed restores appear in Health for one-click apply. Drift detection respects where you placed the SaneBar toggle. If macOS rapidly flaps icon visibility, SaneBar stands down instead of fighting it. Clearer Layout Mode wording.

---

## [2.1.66] - 2026-06-06

Improves wake and display recovery for Hidden and hide-all-other layouts, including helper-owned menu extras.

---

## [2.1.65] - 2026-06-06

Improves reliability for Browse Icons moves out of Always Hidden and reduces background recovery cursor movement risk. Strengthens startup, wake, and exact-ID menu-bar verification.

---

## [2.1.64] - 2026-06-05

Fixes menu bar recovery after wake and display changes; prevents stale geometry from moving visible or always-hidden items when live anchors are missing; keeps hide-all-other boundaries consistent.

---

## [2.1.63] - 2026-06-01

Fixes dynamic menu bar item arrangement after wake, display changes, and Spotlight/helper recovery. Improves recovery replay and auto-hide reliability after wake.

---

### Earlier 2.1.63 notes - 2026-05-29

Fixes dynamic menu bar item jumps on wake, arrange, and Spotlight for 3rd-party helpers (SwiftBar, Fantastical, Lungo, etc.). Broadens shouldResetPersistentStateForStatusItemRecovery to force hard reset to live left-edge anchor on any bad-data reason (missing coordinates, invalid items/geometry) during .wakeResume / .screenParametersChanged / .manualLayoutRestore. Updates recovery policy tests. (Addresses #147, #142, #150)

---

## [2.1.62] - 2026-05-27

Improves wake recovery for dynamic menu bar items, strengthens Hide All Other and Always Hidden replay, and adds release-blocking checks for activation tint, exact-ID moves, auto-rehide, and display wake behavior.

- **Electron App Compatibility**: Implemented "6-step stealth move" logic that finally fixes the "Sticky Icon" issue for Electron apps (Claude, Slack, VibeProxy, etc.). They now respond perfectly to automated moves in Find Icon.
- **Update Reliability**: Fixed a critical issue where auto-updates would fail due to signature verification errors. Updates are now reliable again.
- **Find Icon Performance**: Fixed "beach ball" hanging and 2-second delays when switching tabs in the "Find Icon" window. Thumbnail loading is now lazy and cached.
- **Sparkle Signatures**: Corrected EdDSA signatures for previous releases (v1.0.8-v1.0.11) in the appcast feed to allow them to update successfully.

### Added

### Changed
- **Position Pre-Seeding**: Simplified NSStatusItem positioning (removed 880 lines of cruft)
